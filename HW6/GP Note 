GP Algorithm:

Generate Population -> Generate N random trees, N is the POP_SIZE:
Fill up its Fitness -> Calculate with F*(x) by given X, then Sum up given F(x) - F*(x)^2

randomly use Reproduction, Xover, Mutation the tree for each individuals. 
Note: Xover generate 2 individuals, others 1.

siez_of_tree * 0.1 put into fitness -> punishment 


Question: 
1. Tree Depth --- Can we know the Equation?
2. For each individuals, do one of changes? 
3. How to implement Reproduction?
4. Double check the Xover and Mutation 
5. How to Select individuals?
6. What does initOps(10) exactly do?
